# Calculator
Arbitrary Precision Math Equation Calculator

This Project is for JavaScript based Arbitrary Precision Math only,
and deals with Qt Qml and Felgo Applications,
and it uses Math.js https://mathjs.org/
which uses decimal.js https://github.com/MikeMcl/decimal.js for the Arbitrary Precision Math,
the calculator itself is just an Equation Editor, 
you do not need to use it in your Project, 
you can simply paste or type your equation into the editor box and hit the equal sign (=),
as such the Calculator Code is just for an Example of how to do Math,
as such, the Web based JavaScript requires modifications to run in a Qml JavaScript Engine,
and both Math.Js and Decimal.js are Web based JavaScript Engines only,
since they Currently do not run without warnings and errors under Qml JavaScript Engine,
these are do to minor changes required, that a bash script that runs sed commands will fix,
then it is also this Projects job to ensure these changes do not break the Web version,
so the Calculator is maintained in two or more versions,
I will make sure that a fully functioning version of the Calculator is available for: 

1. Qt Qml
2. Qt Qml Felgo
3. HTML 4 and 5 (PHP compatible)

This project requires changes to the math.js file, 
this is maintained via a bash script called web2qml, 
it can be used to fix any such type of file fixes,
it will make all the changes required, 
to the latest math.js script, and it creates the mathqml.js file used in this project.

This project is not about the Calculator itself, that is just a basic bare bone Qml App, 
all it does is provide a GUI for all the Math being done,
it only creates a string equation that the math parser or eval can run,
this project will also include another project that will create a Web App version of this App,
and it will run the same mathqml.js file, to ensure compatibility with the other JavaScript Engines.

We can all agree that all JavaScript Engines should work the same, and we can all agree they do not, 
this project is all about fixing issues with math.js, decimal.js, and bignumber.js https://github.com/MikeMcl/bignumber.js

This is a community driven project, if you want to contribute, 
file issues or Fork it, 
and all fixes should not be limited to Qml JavaScript Engines only, 
which is why the Web App is included in this project, 
this should also run on all Browser Engines, so please report any bugs or feature request,
and make sure to include what OS and JavaScript Engine.

This project will also include add on library functions that enhance both Math Projects, 
but also keep in mind this Project is all about Qt Qml Felgo,
and as such my goal is to sell this Calculator as a Felgo App on Google Play Store,
and split the money between these 3 Projects,
so this projects goals are to teach others how to do the same,
meaning anyone can sell this Calculator by re-branding its Name,
so people that want to participate in this project, 
can do so by making money with the App itself.
This Project is designed to make a Calculator that is completely Brand-able,
as such the money made from all sells, 
pays for the Commercial License at Felgo: https://felgo.com/pricing,
and Qt License at https://www.qt.io/contact-us,
this Project is also about Open Source,
and will teach you how to use the Free License, 
and will teach you how to compile and distribute Free Software as well,
if fact it is Open Source First, and Commercial Second.

This Project is Open Source, 
all my code is under CopyLeft, meaning it has no Copyright's,
nor any Licenses,
and every project it uses has its own License, 
so this Project is about how to use each License correctly,
and will have detailed instructions on how to write software,
that can be sold using Qt and Felgo as those Commercial Licenses,
and making this project a Legal License Compliant Project,
making sure that all Projects it uses, get paid if they required it,
and even those that do not,
how they get paid is up to them,
but it must be of Legal means in what ever country they reside,
this also includes all those that use and contribute to this code,
in fact selling this App yourself, is the only way you get paid personally for your effort,
because that is the only way to make money contributing to Open Source Projects,
so this Project is Open Source, 
it does not require you to pay them anything,
if you do pay this project, that is a donation,
and treated like one,
so the Money the Projects make and the Money the Contributors make,
is not the same Money, unless the Contributes and People in the Project are the same,
so keep in mind this is Open Source First, Commercial Second,
but more to the point is about how to do this all Legally,
and that includes paying Taxes,
employees, health benefits, and this might mean making your Home your Office,
and all the details for how you as a user can use this project to make money,
and how to pay all those down-line, meaning that you will have to pay for your own Licenses,
since the Project Licenses the Money from Sells pays for,
only applies to this Project, and those that run it,
and directly contribute to it, 
but not the General Public,
this Project is about teaching them how to use the Free License,
and make enough Money to pay for the Commercial one,
and how to Donate to Open Source Projects that you use to Make your Application.

The Actual Company that will be selling this Product has yet to be determined,
but I have no plans on selling this Application myself,
this is a Community Project,
one that bridges the gap between Open Source and Commercial Sells,
and there are people that can can manage this aspect of this Project,
so that will be posted here when that has been established,
and in fact, this whole project might end up pointing there as well,
I just posted this to get those wheels turning.
My Personal Goal is to have either Math.js or Decimal.js to host this Project,
and Manage the Sells,
thus I would just be a Contributor to this Project,
I have Cancer and my Wife is not a Programmer,
and I have my own Galaxy Calculator I am going to sell,
and it will not compete with this one,
in fact this one is just part of that Project as a Page,
and my only Goal is to allow everyone the same opportunity to make money as everyone else that uses it,
so I am not asking for anything I am not willing to make available to others,
because my only Goal is to make this Technology available to all that need it,
and I have not found any Project like this one anywhere,
but I cannot do this alone,
without an underlying Math Library,
this project is nothing,
but this is a project in itself, 
not directly related to the Library it is using,
as such, its loyalty could shift to another Library,
whereas this Project started off as a Math.js project,
but then moved to become a BigNumber.js project,
and now it is back to being a Math.js Decimal.js based Project that if first started off as,
so its loyalty is clear,
I tried every Library I could find,
including all the C++ Solutions,
so currently I have no other Library to try,
but as a Project, it is clear this is a totally different type of Project,
with different Goals,
so how ever this works out,
I hope this project does not die when I do.

Please see the Wiki,
then you will understand why I say it might be better to host this somewhere else,
because I tend to have very long detailed instructions:
https://github.com/Light-Wizzard/Calculator/wiki
and some of them will change your life.
